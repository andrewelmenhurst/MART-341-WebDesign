        The Perks of Being a Wallflower
        </h1>
        <h2> Stephen Chbosky</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p> A socially awkard teen named Charlie
          begins highschool as with little confidence and
          little hope of fitting in. However, his first day
          of class he catches notice of a funny, charismatic
          individual by the name of Patrick.
          </p>
          <p>
            Charlie hesistates and rescinds the idea approaching
            Patrick outside of class that day. Soon after, Charlie
            attends the highschool's first football game, a team that
            his brother stuck out as skilled quarterback. Patrick notices Charlie
            and calls him over. With Patrick sits his step-sister, Sam. Charlie instantly
            falls in love. The three highschoolers continue to frolic into the night
            at a party where Charlie feels a sense of being watching this beautiful reality
            unfold around him.

            <p>
              As Fall turns into Winter, the friendship of these three grows stronger,
              and Charlie begins to witness the love, laughter, trauma, and pain of loving
              someone so strongly as he does with Sam.
              </p>
              <p>
                Charlie never gets the chance to profess his love to Sam,
                as she dated another man with a taste for infidelity. Furthermore,
                Charlie begins to date another girl in the friend group for which he
                has no genuine interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The unrequitted love of Charlie leads to a tension filled night of games where
                  Charlie is asked to kiss the most beautiful woman in the room. He kisses Sam thus evicerating
                  dynamic of the friend group.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, Charlie digresses into a manic episode of self-hatred and past trauma.
                    He doesn't see his friends for some time, and wallows in lonliness. Until the bitter end of the year, where
                    Charlie's friends will graduate, he speaks to Sam. They engage in a long, affectionate talk about
                    feeling so strongly for another, and how scared Charlie is to endure the rest of highschool without Sam and Pat.
                    Sam gives Charlie his first kiss, and he begins to understand that they'll never really be removed from eachother.
                    His friends will be his friends whether they're on the east coast of up in Seattle. This reassures his ability to persist
                    against the bitter existence of being in highschool.
