1. My imaginary client was a promoter for tourism in Montana working to market the ski resorts around Missoula. They described their site needs as improvements in mobile user XI and a polished finish to site content.
2. Mobile-First design is important because the majority of people will be viewing the website you make on their mobile devices, therefore there is a need for user functionality on these smaller screens.
3. The challenges I faced this week were trying to download ttf file fonts from the internet. Last week I struggled with this as well and I could not figure out why they dowloaded as family zip files onto my computer. I overcame this by downloading the TTF files from the example and using those fonts in my styling.
