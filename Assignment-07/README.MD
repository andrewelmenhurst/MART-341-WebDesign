1. The most common forms I come across on the internet are "email invitation" forms from shopping websites like Adidas and Asos.
I believe the primary purpose using placing first party cookies and spamming my email with promotions.
2. An example of text is the value function, which is an attribute that pre-fills a text box. With this, when the user clicks on it, they can edit, remove, or leave the value unchanged.
3. An example of selection is the "selection input" which provides radio buttons to help the user know and apply what is expected. For instance, within an online job app, there may be radio buttons asking if the applicant is seeking full-time or part-time employment.
4. An example of button input is the "submission button". This form requires an ID attribute and sends a form to the server.
5. My work cycle for this assignment began with flipping through the website module for this week and reviewing the modules from
past weeks. I then went to a coffee shop and amped myself up with cold brew. I used the example to reference certain things that I was uncertain about. I feared I would rely on this too heavily, but I find myself doing more and more without needing to switch tabs. I then completed the assignment, and submitted.
