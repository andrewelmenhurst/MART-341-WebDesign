          Hello everyone and welcome to my page! My name is Andrew ELmenhurst and I am a student at the University of Montana.
          I also work at Bridge Pizza and intern with a consulting firm in Washington D.C. I hope this page serves as a virtual
          window into my life.

        <div>
          I am a Business Administration and Marketing major here at the University. I have a unique background as I transferred to the
          University from Portland State. Because of this transfer, I have taken many classes in the humanities as well as many classes in
          stem. This has provided me a unique perspective on the college experience and helped narrow down my interests and passions.

            <div>
            Something I have learned is that there is some artistic aspect to every human being. To me, it is important to be able to feed
            this and express this in some capacity. This is why I decided to major in Marketing. As tactical as it can feel, there are creative
            freedoms that allow us to use our minds in a technical and artistic style. I believe the best marketers in the world have mastered this balance.

            Lastly, my education has pushed me in the direction of analytics. I never thought I would want to deal with data, but I have come to love
            modeling data and understanding the systems behind reporting. Marketing is a incredibly large and complex field, so there are always things to
            discover and explore.
