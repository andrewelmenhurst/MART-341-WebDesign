          In the short time I have been an adult, I have a plethora of experiences that have changed my life. These experiences
          largely shape who I am becoming as a human in this world. People, places, and things seldom resemble one another and
          the frequency from each helps us evolve. I can't quite believe how full my life has been. How full of relationships, of experiences,
          and emotions. Sometimes I sit down and think about it. Sometimes it makes me laugh. Sometimes it makes me cry. But it always reminds
            that life is never as unsaturated as it can feel at times, and its important to recognize the beauty as it unfolds in front of us.

            When I was 21 years old, I worked on a fishing boat in SE Alaska. Traveling thousands of miles from Seattle, Washington, to
            Ketchikan, Alaska, I saw the earth and the oceans in an incredible intimate way that provided me a unprecdented respect for nature.
            During my time here, I saw bears, killer whales, blue whales, dolphins, and thousands of jellyfish. I learned how to dress a salmon
            in under twenty seconds. I learned the native tradition of mending fish net. I learned how to pilot a fishing boat by reading charts,
            radar, and fathometers. I learned how to work for over 24 hours. I learned that a wooden bunk is as comfortable as a king bed if you're tired enough.

            In my late teens and early twenties, I worked as a high-rise windwo cleaner in Portland, Oregon. This job is very dangerous but very fun.
            I think those two things often go hand-in-hand. Swinging from skyscrapers is a thrill that few experience in their lives. I loved working outside,
            even though it rained like hell for most of the year. There is a peace that resides at the top of these gargantuan structures. It is calming to
              nothing but the wind, when the city below remains chaotic and unsettled.

            While working as a window cleaner, I had the privelidge of working with multiple migrant workers from Mexico. These men were the hardest working
            employees I have ever worked with. They showed me love, and they showed me the fastest and most efficient ways to get things done. Window cleaning
            is very laborous and hard on the body, so it is important to have an understanding in these things. Sa√∫l, Jhasmanik, and Carlos treated me like family
            and my time with them improved so much about my life. My Spanish improved quicker in the two years working with them than six years of classes.

            My dad always tells me I have an understanding of life beyond other adults. I don't know how to compare myself in that way, as life experiences and perspective
            don't seem to be something that can be portrayed through words. Perhaps it is a feeling you receive from someone's presence, or the energy they radiate into the
            universe.
