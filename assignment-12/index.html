              August 25, 1991

              Dear friend, I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep
            with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to figure out who she is because then
            you might figure out who I am, and I really don't want you to do that. I will call people by different names or generic
            names because I don't want you to find me. I didn't enclose a return address for the same reason. I mean nothing bad
            by this. Honest.
            </div>
             <div class="second-paragraph">
               I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesn't try to sleep with people even if they could have.
             I need to know that these people exists.
             </div>
              <div>
              I think you of all people would understand that because I think you of all people are alive and appreciate what that means.
              At least I hope you do because other people look to you for strength and friendship and it's that simple. At least thats what I've heard.

                    So, ths is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.
                    I try to think of my family as a reason for me being this way, especialy after my friend Michael stopped going to school
                    one day last spring and we heard Mr. Vaughn's voice on the loudspeaker. "Boy's and girls, I regret to inform you that one of
                    our students has passed on. We will hold a memorial service for Michael Dobson during assembly this Friday."
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    I don't know how news travels around school and why it is very often right. Maybe it was in the lunchroom. Its hard to remember.
                    But Dave with the awkward glasses told us that Michael killed himeself. His mom played bridge with one of Michaels neighbors and they
                    heard the gunshot.
                      </div>
                      <div>
                    I don't really remember much of what happened after that except my older brother came to Mr. Vaughn's office in my middle school
                    and told me to stop crying. Then, he put his arm on my shoulder and told me to get it out of my system before Dad came home.
                    We then went to eat french fries at McDonald's and he taught me how to play pinball. He even made a joke that because of me he got
                    to skip an afternoon of school and asked me if I wanted to help him work on his Camaro. I guess I was pretty messy because he never
                    let me work on his Camaro before.
