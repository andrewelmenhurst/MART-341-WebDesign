1. Padding is the amount of space between the border and the content.
2. The margin is the space between an element and the outer edge of the page.
3. The border is similar to the margin and padding except borders define the space an element takes up in relation to other elements, and it can be styled in width, size, and color.

I haven't been able to sit down and read through the entire module which directly diminishes the quality of my work. But, I have found that staying caffeinated and working in the morning helps with this.
