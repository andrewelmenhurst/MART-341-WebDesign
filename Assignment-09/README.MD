1. Learning HTML has been challenging but more importantly, very interesting. Even learning about the four main elements
seemed a bit intimidating at first. I still struggle with met elements and styling but I have faith that it will become second nature.
2. I'm excited to begin the next module. I struggle with styling and I'm anxious to hone my skills. My goal is to code html and CSS without guidance next year.
3. My challenges have been making sure I include every element, close every tag, and pay attention to the detail so that
my pages function the way I desire. I have overcome these challenges by paying attention to feedback and regularly referencing the module and examples provided. I still forget things but I feel I am beginning to understand the basis of HTML.
