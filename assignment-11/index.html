          "When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two
things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home. I was wishing I looked like Paul Newman--- he looks
tough and I don't--- but I guess my own looks aren't so bad. I have light-brown, almost-red hair and
greenish-gray eyes. I wish they were more gray, because I hate most guys that have green eyes, but I have
to be content with what I have. My hair is longer than a lot of boys wear theirs, squared off in back and
long at the front and sides, but I am a greaser and most of my neighborhood rarely bothers to get a haircut.
Besides, I look better with long hair."
</div>
<div class="second paragraph">
  "I had a long walk home and no company, but I usually lone it anyway, for no reason except that I like to
watch movies undisturbed so I can get into them and live them with the actors. When I see a movie with
someone it's kind of uncomfortable, like having someone read your book over your shoulder. I'm different
that way. I mean, my second-oldest brother, Soda, who is sixteen-going-on-seventeen, never cracks a book
at all, and my oldest brother, Darrel, who we call Darry, works too long and hard to be interested in a story
or drawing a picture, so I'm not like them. And nobody in our gang digs movies and books the way I do.
For a while there, I thought I was the only person in the world that did. So I loned it."
</div>
<div>
  "Soda tries to understand, at least, which is more than Darry does. But then, Soda is different from anybody;
he understands everything, almost. Like he's never hollering at me all the time the way Darry is, or treating
me as if I was six instead of fourteen. I love Soda more than I've ever loved anyone, even Mom and Dad.
He's always happy-go-lucky and grinning, while Darry's hard and firm and rarely grins at all. But then,
Darry's gone through a lot in his twenty years, grown up too fast. Sodapop'll never grow up at all. I don't
know which way's the best. I'll find out one of these days"
</div>
<div>
  "Anyway, I went on walking home, thinking about the movie, and then suddenly wishing I had some
company. Greasers can't walk alone too much or they'll get jumped, or someone will come by and scream
"Greaser!" at them, which doesn't make you feel too hot, if you know what I mean. We get jumped by the
Socs. I'm not sure how you spell it, but it's the abbreviation for the Socials, the jet set, the West-side rich
kids. It's like the term "greaser," which is used to class all us boys on the East Side."
</div>
<div>
  "We're poorer than the Socs and the middle class. I reckon we're wilder, too. Not like the Socs, who jump
greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks, and get editorials in the paper for being a public
disgrace one day and an asset to society the next. Greasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive
old souped-up cars and hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while. I don't mean I do things
like that. Darry would kill me if I got into trouble with the police. Since Mom and Dad were killed in an
auto wreck, the three of us get to stay together only as long as we behave. So Soda and I stay out of trouble
as much as we can, and we're careful not to get caught when we can't. I only mean that most greasers do
things like that, just like we wear our hair long and dress in blue jeans and T-shirts, or leave our shirttails
out and wear leather jackets and tennis shoes or boots. I'm not saying that either Socs orgreasers are better;
that's just the way things are."
</div>
<div>
  "I could have waited to go to the movies until Darry or Sodapop got off work. They would have gone with
me, or driven me there, or walked along, although Soda just can't sit still long enough to enjoy a movie and
they bore Darry to death. Darry thinks his life is enough without inspecting other people's. Or I could have
gotten one of the gang to come along, one of the four boys Darry and Soda and I have grown up with and
consider family. We're almost as close as brothers; when you grow up in a tight-knit neighborhood like
ours you get to know each other real well. If I had thought about it, I could have called Darry and he would
have come by on his way home and picked me up, or Two-Bit Mathews--- one of our gang--- would have
come to get me in his car if I had asked him, but sometimes I just don't use my head. It drives my brother
Darry nuts when I do stuff like that, 'cause I'm supposed to be smart; I make good grades and have a high
IQ and everything, but I don't use my head. Besides, I like walking."
