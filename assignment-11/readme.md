1. System fonts are fonts that are already installed on your computer. However they may not be available to the web.
2. Web fonts are fonts that are hosted on a server. These make up the majority of what we see on websites, however they are not
bullet-proof in regards to compatibility and functionality.
3. Web-safe fonts are those that developers count on to always be available. Client computers will always have these fonts which increases overall performance.
4. Fallback fonts and stacks provide the system a secondary font to run should the primary font fail.
5. A challenge I faced this week was attention to detail in linking my style sheets to my index page. I ended up referring to my last weeks assignment to specify what I was missing, which ended up being a period.
