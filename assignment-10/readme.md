1. The universal selector is used to style every element and uses a "*". The element selector is used to select a specific
type of element in its entirety. So for instance, if you wanted to color all the headings on your sheet in the same way, you could do this with the element selector. The class selector is another way to style elements. It is beneficial for selecting elements that serve the same function. The ID-selector allows users to define specific styling rules for a specific element by calling it's unique ID. This may be beneficial for specific lines and elements.
2. Three colors I chose for my page are Purple, Violet, and Gold. The 1960's style very much utilizes bright, vibrant colors that don't necessarily have to match. Especially writing about Hendrix, Purple Haze and the Jimmy Hendrix Experience immediately come to mind. To me, this style was a way for people to wear the volume of the music on their bodies.
3. Some challenges I faced this week was envisioning the design of my page while coding it. I know there are more in-depth ways to design. For instance, I would have liked to have a tie-dyed background, and a retro font. Perhaps I will do more research on unique styles in the future.
